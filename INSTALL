Conditions:

You have to install at least libsdl1.2-dev and libsdl_mixer1.2-dev to
be able to build the SDL video and SDL audio driver module. On not 
debian-based systems this dev-packages will be named different.

Please add the DATA and GFX folders of the original game to the
following folder: ../trunk/build/S2/

Installation:

cd build
./cmake.sh $options	(see below)
make
make install            or rather ./start.sh


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Options:

--enable-debug           Enables Debug-Build
--prefix                 Usually /usr/local, alternativly you can use 
                         "." - relative paths work
--arch=x                 compile for architecture x
                         x = "system.platform", i.e apple.universal
                         use "c.system.platform" to use special cross-compile
                         rules (if not detected automatically)
--disable-arch=x         disables on specific architecture x
                         x = platform, i.e ppc
                         can be supplied multiple times
                         normally only used for removing a specific platform
                         from apple universal builds

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

./cleanup.sh             Cleans all files created by cmake.sh and make

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Windows:

Extract "contrib\full-contrib-msvc2010.rar".

Now open "win32\vs2010\s25client.sln" with Visual Studio 2010

After that, use "View" "Other Windows" "Property Manager" to 
add the property-manager to your vs2010 view - in it, open one 
loaded project of your choice, and double click on "Microsoft.Cpp.Win32.user"

It should start on the entry "VC Directories"
Now add following paths:
ExecutableDirs: "path/to/s25rttr/contrib/full-contrib-msvc2010/bin"
IncludeDirs: "path/to/s25rttr/contrib/full-contrib-msvc2010/include"
LibraryDirs: "path/to/s25rttr/contrib/full-contrib-msvc2010/lib"

and press OK
If you press "Build" "Build Solution" now, it should create the complete project.

To debug within visual studio 2010,
you should either put

#define GAMEDIR "path/to/s2"

into your build_paths.h or copy "DATA" and "GFX" from your settlers 2 installation to 
the same directory, where "build_paths.h" is.

For both variants, you have to put "$(SolutionDir)\..\.." into "Working Directory" in 
"Project Properties / Debugging"
